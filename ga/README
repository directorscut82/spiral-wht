=========================================

To compile:
   make clean
   make depend
   make

Example run:
   ga 20 -p 150 -g 150 -b 20 -c 40 -m 20 -s 73898

Usage statement:
   Usage: whtga transform_size
	  [-p population_size] [-g generations]
	  [-b best_kept] [-c crossed] [-m mutated[g#t#j#s#u#d#f#m#]]
	  [-i injected_rand_trees]
	  [-tree_gen uniform|series|joining|rand] [-leaf min,max]
	  [-draw weight|tournament=size] [-fitness reciprocal|measured]
	  [-e 'measure_executable measure_options']
	  [-s random_seed]
	  [-z testing_mode_only]

Notes on usage:
   - Run just "whtga" to get usage statement
   - Semi-reasonable defaults are provided for all options
   - Note the old "[-e epochs]" option has become "[-g generations]", and
     a new "-e" option has been added (see below).
   - When mutating, the kind of mutation is chosen randomly with weight
     propotional to that specified.
     The mutations are:
        Grow, Truncate
	Join, Split
	Up, Down
	Flip
	Move
     So, "-m 10g1t1j0s0u2d2f0m0" would mutate 10 individuals per generation,
        favoring Up and Down 2 to 1 over Grow and Truncate, and would not
	Join, Split, Flip, or Move ever.
   - "-i 10" says to inject 10 completely random trees each generation
   - "-l 2,6" says to only generate trees with leaves between 2-6 inclusive.
     Note that the "uniform" tree generation scheme does not support a min
     leaf other than 1 (and no warnings are printed).
   - Fitness function can either be the reciprocal of the measured item,
     or simply the measured item.  Note that the GA always tries to
     maximize the fitness (thus the reciprocal minimizes the measured item).
   - "-e '../../code/wht/pclprof -e PCL_STALL'" will run pclprof to measure
     stalls


The default settings are:
whtga 100 -p 100 -g 100 -b 10 -c 30 -m 20g1t1j1s1u1d1f1m0 -i 10
   -tree_gen joining -leaf 2,6 -draw weight -fitness reciprocal
   -e './measure' -s 8349

Look at options.h for global options that can't be set at the command line


Other utilities:
   plot_best_ave.sh -- gnuplot's the best and average times for a GA run
   best_ave.m       -- Matlab code for the same
